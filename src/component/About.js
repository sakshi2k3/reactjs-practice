              First Fiddle Restaurants, formerly known as The Lazeez Affaire
              Group, was conceived in the year 1999 by Priyank Sukhija and Y.P.
              Ashok. Since then, the company has made a name for itself as
              innovators and leaders in the industry. Starting with their first
              brand, Lazeez Affaire, Priyank popularised the conceptof fine
              dining at a time when the same was unheard of. Following its
              success, First Fiddle introduced the concept of casual dining with
              brands such as Warehouse Cafe, Tamasha, Lord of The Drinks, Flying
              Saucer Cafe, and more, storming Delhi’s nightlife. WIth each new
              brand, First Fiddle brought a concept that was never experienced
              or heard of before, such as Plum by Bent Chair, Miso Sexy, Diablo,
              and more. The restaurants are spread all over India in major
              metropolitan cities like New Delhi, Mumbai, Pune, Lucknow and
              more, with plans to expand internationally soon.

              With over 30 restaurants in 23 years under his belt, the prolific
              restaurateur Priyank Sukhija has become somewhat of a legend in
              the industry, starting his journey at a mere age of 19. Priyank
              was the first in his family to venture into business, hailing from
              a family of lawyers, going on to create an empire in F&B.
              Following his heart and tongue through his F&B career, Priyank has
              successfully created some of the most talked-about brands in the
              industry - Diablo, Lord of the Drinks, Plum by Bent Chair, Lazeez
              Affaire, Tamasha, The Flying Saucer Cafe, and many more
