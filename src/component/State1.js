              dining at a time when the same was unheard of. Following its
              success, First Fiddle introduced the concept of casual dining with
              brands such as Warehouse Cafe, Tamasha, Lord of The Drinks, Flying
              Saucer Cafe, and more, storming Delhiâ€™s nightlife. WIth each new
              brand, First Fiddle brought a concept that was never experienced
              or heard of before, such as Plum by Bent Chair, Miso Sexy, Diablo,
              and more. The restaurants are spread all over India in major
              metropolitan cities like New Delhi, Mumbai, Pune, Lucknow and
              more, with plans to expand internationally soon.</p>
